Usability Testing 

Result/Changes:
Based on what our testers told us, the app has a lot of work to do. 
They noticed many things that we were missing that well get into here.

Task 1:
They all struggled to be able to find out how to delete a post. Once
 they did figure out how to delete it they thought the icon looked ugly.
They think it should be made more clear how to get to the screen to delete 
a post if you dont like it.



Task 2:
When asked about the caption this method seems to be very favorable. They found it very easy
They mentioned how they didnt see the website name or logo anywhere on the screen.
They think that that should be a very important part to a project.
to see, however one tester

did use the word "a lot" when describing the caption due to the large size of them.
The first question was to rate how easy it was for them to read the prompt. These are the results
in order . This
comes out to an average of 9.33/10. The reasoning for this was because the font was so big
they were effortlessly able to
read this.
The next question was about how they felt about the size of the font. They said in order 7,7,7.
They all had the same feeling about
this one. When I asked them to explain why they chose this number they just said that it was
larger than they needed.

Task 3:
This was a much quicker task. Due to this method being the one post displayed per line, it took
a decently long time to get to the bottom.
One tester however mentioned that they didn't mind it since other social media platforms use
the same style. When asked to rate this
The testers said . This comes out to an average of 
Three post displayed per line:

Task 1:
The first question asked to them was what they thought about the clearness of the picture they
were seeing.
They tested with random images which led to them using different image sizes. I thought it was
important
to allow for different image sizes, because it's possible a user tries to upload an image of the
same size.
For the clearness, the ratings in order were . This comes out to an average of  Most
images came
out looking pretty clear. When asked how they thought of the three post compared to the
singular post, one
tester said he enjoyed it because he's able to see a lot of information at one time
When testing for what they thought of the size of the image they seemed to enjoy it. Their
ratings in order were
 This comes out to an average rating of The testers mainly had the same feeling.
By making the post smaller
testers were able to see a lot of images which they seemed to enjoy. Even though tester #2
disliked the image quality
they still gave the image size a rating of a .

Task 2:
The next test was the caption. Testers felt that because the post were so close to each other
that it led to
there is a lot of text on the screen at once. When asked to rate reading the caption 1-10, they
said
7,6,6. That's an average of 6.33/10. Even though they complained about the quantity of text
they didn't
let it affect their ability to read a single post.
When testing the size of the font they said 5 This comes to an average of 6/10.

Task 3:
This is the main advantage that this test has over the other. Testers were able to get to the
bottom three times as fast.
This is something that can be very helpful as the app continues to grow. When asked to rate it
1-10, they said 8,8,9. That
comes to an average of 8.33/10. Users enjoyed the quick speed and were able to find posts
quickly.
Comparison:
Overall testers seemed to enjoy both options. The main appeal to the single post was suppose
to be that it made the comments and
image more viewable. However it seemed to have the opposite effect as some testers became
overwhelmed from the size.
It also did take a very long time to reach the bottom of the single post. Testers complained about
the the three post being
too text heavy, however they all rated the captions decently high so it didn't seem to be too
much of an issue. The testers
preferred the three post format as they felt it is more effective for utilizing efficiency on our app.
