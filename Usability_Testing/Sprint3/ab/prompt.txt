A/B Testing Script
Introduction:
Hi, {user’s name}. My name is {my name}, how are you doing today?
I really appreciate you taking time to participate in this testing.
So let me explain how this will go. I will start by asking a few background questions about
yourself. And I will then ask you to perform some tasks on our social media application. Once
the tasks have been completed, I would like you to give some feedback about our application.
Do you have any questions before we start?
Background question:
So, {user’s name}. What social media platforms are you using in your daily life?
Which one do you use the most?
How often do you use this social media?
Tasks:
Thanks for your answers. We are now ready to start the test. Before we start, I would like to
remind you of a few things. First off, remember that we aren’t testing you today, we’re testing
our application. So if something isn’t working, don’t worry, it’s a problem with our software and
not something you’ve done wrong. In fact, there are no wrong answers here. Don’t feel bad
while complaining about this application. The more feedback you give, the better change we
could make to our application.
Guidelines:
The main thing that is being tested today is the structure of the post being
displayed. The first option is to have three post displayed on one line which allows
for us to maximize the space we have and show lots of post without having to scroll.
The other option is to have one post displayed which allows for the post size to be increased.
In both of these options the goal of viewing a post is preformed, however its up to the user
to decide which is better. The way we will mesaure which option functions better is by asking
the user the same questions and having them rate specific areas.
So let’s being, please go to the link that is provided and share your screen
Task 1:
So right now I would like you to make a post that has around 50-75 words in its caption(it can be
random words)?
How clear is the picture you are seeing, give it a rating of 1-10?
What do you think about the size of the picture, give it a rating of 1-10?
Task 2:
Now using the same post from Task 1, I want you to look at the caption?
How hard do you think it is for you to read the caption,, give it a rating of 1-10?
Do you like the size of the font, give it a rating of 1-10?
Task 3:
So right now I would like you to try to scroll to the bottom of the page.
Was that a reasonable amount of time to get to the bottom of the page, give it a rating of 1-10?
Feedback:
And that’s the final task finished. Before we leave I would like to ask you about some general
feedback about our application so far?
Thank you for that. Is there anything you would like to add before we finish up?
Great, I would like to end this testing at this moment. Thank you again so much for taking the
time to take this test. Your feedback will be extremely helpful for us. I would like to end this
testing at this moment. Have a nice day!
