Sprint 4 Usability Testing

Based on the feedback we received from our tester, there are a few things that we need to improve.

Right now for both the desktop and mobile versions, we need to have a functionality where we can 

suggest friends with people who have similar top games to that user. This new functionality will ease 

a new user experience of making friends on the platform. With new functionality. While all three users

did not have trouble using the app. There were a few issues where messaging will not be responsive. 

However, the backend of the project does not have websockets implemented. There is no possible chance 

that there will be persistent updates, the user just has to wait 5 seconds for receiving a message from another user.

Secondly, while the platform was responsive on multiple devices' screen sizes, there was good feedback

 where there were no issues with having different sizes. The one problem pointed out was that the mobile 

 version of the website's top 3 games needs to be fixed. They said the way we currently have it doesn't 

 have the same appeal that it has in the desktop version. The way we will improve this is that instead of 

 having the games listed vertically, we will change them so they are horizontal and no longer include the pictures.

When trying to test searching for friends on the platform all of the users ran into the same issue.

 Our intention was that if you have a private profile then only your friends should be able to see your post.

  However, we noticed that if you aren't friends with someone who is private and try to search for them, you'll 

  be able to see their posts. This is a complete security issue. We intend on changing this code around as soon 

  as possible making it so that private users are only visible to their friends.

Overall our app seems to be in good standing, we just have some minor issues to take care of. After these 

issues are resolved we should have a complete application.
