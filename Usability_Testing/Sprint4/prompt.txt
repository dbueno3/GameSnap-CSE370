Usability Testing Script Introduction:
Hi, {Test User name}. My name is {Daniel or Eric; Who the tester was}, how are you doing today?
I really appreciate you taking the time to participate in this testing.
So let me explain how this will go. I will start by asking a few background questions about yourself. And I will then ask you to perform some tasks on our social media application. Once the tasks have been completed, I would like you to give feedback about our application.
Do you have any questions before we start? Background question:
So Tirth. What social media platforms are you using in your daily life? Which one do you use the most?
How often do you use this social media?
Tasks:
Thanks for your answers. We are now ready to start the test. Before we start, I would like to remind you of a few things. First off, remember that we aren’t testing you today, we’re testing our application. So if something isn’t working, don’t worry, it’s a problem with our software and not something you’ve done wrong. In fact, there are no wrong answers here. Don’t feel bad while complaining about this application. The more feedback you give, the better chance we could make to our application.
So let’s begin, please go to the link that is provided and share your screen
Task 1:
So right now I would like you to register an account and log into the web app and pick your three top video games.
How hard do you think it is for you to register and log in and add your top three games to the application?
Do you find any things that are not reasonable for you?
Task 2:
So right now I would like you to try to search for a friend on the platform.
How hard do you think it is for you to find a friend?
Do you find anything that is not reasonable for you while searching for a friend?
Task 3:
So right now I would like you to try to make a message conversation with a friend. How hard do you think it is for you to create a message thread with a friend?
Do you find any things that are not reasonable for you while sending a message?
Feedback:
And that’s the final task finished. Before we leave I would like to ask you about some general feedback about our application so far?
Thank you for that. Is there anything you would like to add before we finish up?
Great, I would like to end this testing at this moment. Thank you again so much for taking the time to take this test. Your feedback will be extremely helpful to us. I would like to end this testing at this moment. Have a nice day!
